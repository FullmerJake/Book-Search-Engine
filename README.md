  ## Installation
  First you need to clone the repo to your computer. Once you've done that, make sure that you open a terminal at the root folder of the application and run npm install to get all the dependancies. Once you've done that you can code away to your hearts content. npm start will start the server so you can see what the changes you make will do to the application. 

  ## Usage
  Once you've navigated to the site hosting the application, simply log in and start searching for books. Navigate to the Saved Books tab to see which books you've saved and remove any that you no longer need. There will be a button at the bottom of the cards that allow you to save and delete the books to and from your profile.

  ## Contribution
  This was originally developed using a RESTful API and was adapted into using GraphQL. The next best step would be to migrate it to use as a mobile application, that can be used with or without internet.
